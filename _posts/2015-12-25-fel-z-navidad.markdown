¡Felíz navidad!

Es la noche buena.

It’s Christmas Eve, and I start a new semester in 10 days. Time to start thinking about how that will go. The first semester didn’t go so well. There were lots of bumps in the road. Some of them were almost boulders. My objective is to smooth out the bumps and reduce the boulders to gravel. After years teaching students with disabilities, this was my first effort at teaching students a new language.
